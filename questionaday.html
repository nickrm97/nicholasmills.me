    <h1>Question a Day</h1>
    <p>
      How often do you take the time to reflect? Question a Day is a simple
      mobile app which helps you take a minute every day to practice
      self-reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyday, the app will prompt you with 2-3 thought-provoking questions.
      eg. "What is your happiest memory?"
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you respond to these questions, your answer is shared anoynmously
      with other respondents. If you want you can view and comment on the other
      anonymous responses, and read helpful articles related to the daily
      questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every now and again, we'll ask you the same question. Once you answer,
      we'll compare and see if your responses have changed over time.
    </p>
